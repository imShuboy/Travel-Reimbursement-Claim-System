# Travel-Reimbursement-Claim-System

Goal of the Project: A travel reimbursement claim system streamlines the process of reimbursing official travel expenses by automating and expediting claims. It replaces manual, paper-based methods, reducing administrative burdens and saving time for employees and finance teams.  

The system enables digital submission of claims with receipts, automates verification for policy compliance, and accelerates reimbursements, enhancing employee satisfaction. Additionally, it provides insights into travel expenses, helping organizations analyze spending and optimize policies for cost savings.
